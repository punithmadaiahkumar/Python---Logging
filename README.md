# Python Logging
Logging is a Python module in the standard library that provides the facility to work with the framework for releasing log messages from the Python programs. Logging is used to tracking events that occur when the software runs.

## Logging Levels:

+ DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.

+ INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.

+ WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.

+ ERROR: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.

+ CRITICAL: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.
